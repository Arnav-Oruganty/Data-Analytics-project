# DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT 
- #### Class : 12th
- #### Subject : Informatics Practices

##  Introduction

 This project deals with detailed analysis of various aspects related to
development in India since the year 1950. These aspects of development include
the **Literacy Rate, GDP, Import and Export Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Pollution
Rate etc.** Our primary objective for this project is to spread awareness amongst
people about the factors contributing towards India development. By the means of
this project, the user will get information about the different developmental
aspects that he chooses to view. All this information will be mainly provided
through tabular and graphical interpretation formats. This will lead to better
visualisation of crucial nodes we need to work upon so that we gradually ensure
India’s development growth stability


## Front-End

  Front-End is the development environment where we write the program code
to develop the interface so that the user can communicate with the system. We
have used `Python` using the `SPYDER IDE` from `Anaconda Distribution` to develop
the project.

## Back-End

  Back-End refers to the database where data is stored. I have used `CSV
Files` as Back-End to store my data of 10 different aspects of development in
which have been explored in our project.
